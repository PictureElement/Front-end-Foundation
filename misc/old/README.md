## Synopsis

This project is an ever-changing website dedicated to front-end fundamentals.
The primary use of this page is to demonstrate fundamental topics/concepts in
HTML, CSS, and JacaScript.

## Example

Some examples of topics/concepts related to HTML are "Elements", "Forms", and
"Input types".

Some examples of topics/concepts related to CSS are "Selectors", "Color", and
"Box model".

Each topic/concept is an HTML document by itself organized as follows:
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <!-- Site heading, navigation menu -->
    <header>
      ...
    </header>
    <main>
      <!-- Major topic/concept -->
      <article>
        <!-- Byline -->
        <header>
          ...
        </header>
        <!-- Subsection #1 -->
        <section>
          ...
        </section>
        <!-- Subsection #2 -->
        <section>
          ...
        </section>
        ...
        <!-- Subsection #N -->
        <section>
          ...
        </section>
      </article>
    </main>
    <footer>
      ...
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```
